<h1>Speed Announcer</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If a speed sensor is operational, this apps helps on announcing the speed without the units</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Install the app. It will appear on the user application Menu.</p>
<p>Choose the speed sensor</p>
<p>Adjust the switch that will activate the speech.</p>
<p>The Min Speed set the speed below which the announces are exactly the current speed.</p>
<p>Above this speed, only tenths are announced (i.e. 90 instead of 91 or 92).</p>
<p>Pay special attention to units!!. Maybe your sensor does not report the speed on the standard Jeti units.</p>
<p>Standard units are (case sensitive):</p>
<li>m/s : Meters per second</li>
<li>km/h : Kilometers per hour</li>
<li>ft/s : Feets per second</li>
<li>mph : Miles per hour</li>
<li>kt. : Knots</li>
<p>If your sensor reports the speed on any other unit, the application will consider it is reporting on m/s</p>
